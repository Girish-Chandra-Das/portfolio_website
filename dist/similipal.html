          <p>The Similipal Biosphere in Mayurbhanj district of Odisha is a nature loverâ€™s delight. With a reserve forest area of over 2750 sq km, Similipal Wildlife Sanctuary is one of the biggest in the country. Housing a variety of wild animals, including Royal Bengal Tigers, 304 species of birds and plants, the sanctuary is extremely rich in biodiversity. The core area of Similipal Tiger Reserve extends up to 1194 sq km and the buffer area measures 1555 sq km. As per the last tiger census, Similipal has around 25 Royal Bengal Tigers and the biosphere is also home to Similipal-Kuldiha-Hadgarh elephant reserve.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Few months back, the authorities of Similipal Tiger Reserve set up an eco-tourism complex with bamboo cottages at Kumari near Gurguria within the sanctuary limits in addition to the two eco-complexes that are already operating at Gurguria and Jamuani. Reservations here can be done through the Deputy Director of Similipal Tiger Reserve (06792-259126) or www.toshaliresort.com. For day visitors, the Forest Department is now providing a 13-seater vehicle for tourists for visits within Similipal from Jashipur on the route Jashipur-Gurguria-Uski-Barehipani-Joranda-Chahala and back to Jashipur via Tulsibani at Rs. 5,550 per day.</p>
          <br>
          <p>Every year, the sanctuary remains closed from June to November-end for monsoon and maintenance. Even the sanctuary remains closed during this period, nature lovers can enjoy Sitakund, Bhimkund and Devkund waterfalls located nearby. Within the sanctuary, there are two magnificent waterfalls, namely Bareipani and Joranda. Entry permits to the sanctuary have to be obtained from forest range officers of Jasipur and Pithabata. From Jasipur side, there are three entry routes and from Pithabata, tourists can enter the sanctuary from four entry points.</p>
